# Homework project

In this project we should create android application which can convert 4 types of units. Each conversion type is "working" in its own activity,
and there is one activity for results which is used by all 4 activities.In this app its possible to convert units in data,
distance,speed and temperature.

### The assignment and problems encountered

In this assignment problem was dealing with conversion of same types(GB to GB for example). Converting between same types is allowed, so
if GB to GB (data conversion) is chosen for example, it will still show results on activity_Results.

Also there was problems with going back to previous activity. In this app it can be done with physical buttons on device(back button),
or swiping from left to right side of screen.
